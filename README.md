# Who am I?

  

Hi, My name is **Playfairs**, I am a semi-mature Developer, I mostly focus on creating Websites and Bots, sometimes I make scripts as well, such as tools for platforms such as Xbox, where I originally started my interest in coding in general.


# Current Projects


**Current Projects** include such as my Website, [playfairs.cc](https://playfairs.cc), and [heresy](https://heresy.vercel.app), to which I have not yet purchased a domain for Heresy, as I am still unsure if I want to continue working on it, I am currently working on rewriting a Discord Bot, which I may or may not make open source, if not, I'll leak the old source.
